# jax-emacs-setup
This is where I store all of my custom emacs configs and lisps.

Some cool features:

* A `custom-init.el` file, where you can store any sensitive configs that you
don't want in a git repo. It's also great for setting up configs for different
machines.
* A separate folder for any copy and pasted/created lisps in `lisps/`
* Theme - Monokai with ProFontWindows. Looks great on any monitor!
* The ability to use a simple `C-y` in `ansi-term` for pasting
* Pulls in your `PATH` in `ansi-term`
* Line Numbers! On Everything! For now. Hopefully, I can get this to only happen
for certain major modes. If you have any suggestions, add an issue.
* Helm, Projectile, Smex, Ido-Vertical and more for completion ease of use
* Auto-modes for Python, Javascript, Coldfusion (don't ask...), HTML, CSS, LESS and Org files
